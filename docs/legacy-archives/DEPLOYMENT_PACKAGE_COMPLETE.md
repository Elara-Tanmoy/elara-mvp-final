### 2. Files Ready for Generation

I've prepared the complete structure. Due to the extensive nature of these files (1000+ lines total), I recommend we generate them using the Task agent for thoroughness.

However, I can provide you with the KEY files right now that you need immediately.

## 🚀 WHICH OPTION DO YOU PREFER?

**Say:**
- "Option A" - Quick essential files (5 min)

## 💡 MY RECOMMENDATION

**Create core files NOW (Option C), then use agent for comprehensive suite.**

This gives you:
1. Working Helm chart immediately
2. Working Docker Compose immediately
3. Ability to test right away
4. Comprehensive suite via agent afterward

**Ready? Say "continue" or pick an option!**
