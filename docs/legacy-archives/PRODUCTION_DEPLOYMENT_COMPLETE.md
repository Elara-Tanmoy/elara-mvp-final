## 4. Cost Estimate

### 4.1 Monthly Cost Breakdown

#### Baseline Configuration (All Replicas Active)

| Component | Specification | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Cloud Run - Backend** | 6 regions × 2 min instances × 2GB RAM | $432.00 |
| **Cloud Run - Frontend** | 6 regions × 2 min instances × 1GB RAM | $216.00 |
| **Cloud SQL (PostgreSQL)** | db-custom-2-7680 with HA | $280.00 |
| **Memorystore (Redis)** | 1GB Basic tier | $45.00 |
| **Cloud Storage** | 100GB multi-region + egress | $35.00 |
| **Load Balancer** | Global with forwarding rules | $250.00 |
| **Cloud Armor** | Security policies + rules | $75.00 |
| **VPC Networking** | NAT gateways + VPC connectors | $180.00 |
| **Secret Manager** | 20 secrets × 6 versions | $12.00 |
| **Cloud Monitoring** | Metrics, logs, alerting | $85.00 |
| **BigQuery** | 10GB storage + 100GB queries | $50.00 |
| **Total (Baseline)** | | **$1,660.00/month** |

#### Optimized Configuration (Reduced Replicas)

| Component | Specification | Monthly Cost |
|-----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Cloud Run - Backend** | 6 regions × 0-1 min instances | $216.00 |
| **Cloud Run - Frontend** | 6 regions × 0-1 min instances | $108.00 |

### 4.2 Cost Optimization Recommendations

1. **Start with optimized configuration** - Set min_instances = 0 in low-traffic regions
2. **Monitor actual usage** - Review billing after first month
3. **Adjust by region** - Keep min_instances = 1 only in primary regions
4. **Enable autoscaling** - Let Cloud Run scale to 0 during low traffic
5. **Use committed use discounts** - 30% savings on Cloud SQL with 1-year commitment

## 5. Deployment Instructions

### 5.1 Option 1: One-Click Deployment (Recommended)

The fastest way to deploy the entire platform:

```bash
# Navigate to infrastructure directory
cd D:/Elara_MVP/elara-platform/infrastructure

# Make deploy script executable (if on Linux/Mac)
chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh

# Run one-click deployment
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

The script will:
1. Validate prerequisites (gcloud, terraform, docker)
2. Prompt for project configuration
3. Initialize Terraform
4. Create all infrastructure (30-45 minutes)
5. Migrate secrets to Secret Manager
6. Build and deploy Docker images
7. Run database migrations
8. Verify deployment health
9. Display endpoints and next steps

### 5.2 Option 2: Manual Deployment

For step-by-step control, see the complete guide in `DEPLOYMENT.md`:

```bash
# 1. Initialize Terraform
cd infrastructure/terraform
terraform init

# 2. Review deployment plan
terraform plan -var="project_id=YOUR_PROJECT_ID" -var="domain=your-domain.com"

# 3. Apply infrastructure
terraform apply -var="project_id=YOUR_PROJECT_ID" -var="domain=your-domain.com"

# 4. Migrate secrets
cd ../scripts
./migrate-secrets.sh

# 5. Deploy with Cloud Build
gcloud builds submit --config=../cloudbuild.yaml ../..
```

### 5.3 Expected Duration

| Phase | Time | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| Prerequisites validation | 2-5 min | Check tools and configuration |
| Terraform initialization | 1-2 min | Download providers and modules |
| Infrastructure creation | 25-35 min | Create all GCP resources |
| Secret migration | 2-3 min | Upload secrets to Secret Manager |
| Docker build & deploy | 8-12 min | Build images and deploy to Cloud Run |
| Database migrations | 1-2 min | Run schema migrations |
| Health checks | 2-3 min | Verify all services |
| **Total** | **30-45 min** | Full deployment |

## 9. Post-Deployment Tasks

### 9.1 DNS Configuration

After deployment completes, configure your domain DNS:

**Step 1: Get Load Balancer IP**
```bash
terraform output load_balancer_ip
# Example output: 34.120.45.67
```

**Step 2: Create DNS Records**

Add these records to your DNS provider:

| Type | Name | Value | TTL |
|------|------|-------|-----|
| A | `@` | `34.120.45.67` | 300 |
| A | `www` | `34.120.45.67` | 300 |
| A | `api` | `34.120.45.67` | 300 |
| CNAME | `app` | `your-domain.com` | 300 |

**Step 3: Verify DNS Propagation**
```bash
# Check if DNS has propagated
dig your-domain.com
dig api.your-domain.com
```

### 9.2 SSL Certificate Verification

Google-managed SSL certificates take 10-60 minutes to provision:

**Check Certificate Status**:
```bash
gcloud compute ssl-certificates list
```

Wait until status shows `ACTIVE` before proceeding.

### 9.3 Endpoint Verification

Test all endpoints after DNS and SSL are configured:

**Backend API**:
```bash
curl https://api.your-domain.com/health
# Expected: {"status": "healthy", "timestamp": "..."}
```

**Frontend**:
```bash
curl https://your-domain.com
# Expected: HTML content with React app
```

**WebSocket** (if applicable):
```bash
wscat -c wss://api.your-domain.com/ws
# Expected: WebSocket connection established
```

### 9.4 Database Migration Verification

Ensure all migrations ran successfully:

```bash
# SSH into Cloud SQL proxy or use Cloud Shell
gcloud sql connect elara-db --user=elara_user

# Check migration status
SELECT * FROM schema_migrations ORDER BY version DESC LIMIT 10;
```

### 9.5 Monitoring Setup

1. **Access Cloud Monitoring Dashboard**:
   - Navigate to: https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring
   - Select "Dashboards" > "Elara Platform Dashboard"

2. **Configure Alert Notifications**:
   - Add email addresses for alert notifications
   - Set up PagerDuty integration (optional)
   - Configure SMS notifications for critical alerts

3. **Set Up Log Explorer**:
   - Create saved queries for common searches
   - Set up log-based metrics
   - Configure log export to BigQuery

### 9.6 Initial Data Setup

If needed, populate initial data:

```bash
# Run seed scripts
gcloud run jobs execute elara-seed-job --region=us-central1

# Or manually via Cloud SQL
gcloud sql connect elara-db --user=elara_user < seed.sql
```

### 9.7 Security Hardening

Final security checks:

- [ ] Verify Cloud Armor rules are active
- [ ] Test rate limiting (should block after 100 req/min)
- [ ] Confirm database has no public IP
- [ ] Verify all secrets are in Secret Manager (not .env files)
- [ ] Enable MFA for all admin accounts
- [ ] Review IAM permissions (principle of least privilege)
