# Complete Snapshot/Restore Test - Execution Guide

**Purpose:** Prove with 100% certainty that snapshot/restore works before deleting production resources

**Test Duration:** 45-60 minutes
**Test Cost:** ~$20 (temporary test project resources)
**Outcome:** Written certification that system works or list of issues to fix

---

## 🎯 What This Test Does

This comprehensive test will:

1. ✅ **Capture production state** (exact configuration before snapshot)
2. ✅ **Create encrypted snapshot** (full backup of everything)
3. ✅ **Restore to test project** (new isolated environment)
4. ✅ **Compare byte-by-byte** (production vs test match exactly)
5. ✅ **Validate functionality** (all features work in test)
6. ✅ **Generate evidence report** (written proof of success/failure)

**At the end, you get a PASS/FAIL certificate with detailed evidence.**

---

## 🚀 Test Execution - Step by Step

### Step 1: Create Test Project in GCP Console (2 minutes)

**Option A: Use GCP Console (Recommended)**
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
2. Click project dropdown → "New Project"
3. Project name: `elara-test-20251023-yourname`
4. Click "Create"
5. Wait for project creation (~30 seconds)

**Option B: Use Command Line**
```powershell
# Replace with your unique project ID
$testProject = "elara-test-20251023-yourname"
gcloud projects create $testProject
```

### Step 2: Set Execution Policy (if needed)

```powershell
# Open PowerShell 7 as Administrator
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Step 3: Run Comprehensive Test

```powershell
# Navigate to scripts directory
cd D:\Elara_MVP\gcp-infrastructure\scripts

# Create secure passphrase
$passphrase = ConvertTo-SecureString "Elara$Test$2025!SecurePassword" -AsPlainText -Force

# Run comprehensive test
.\test-snapshot-restore-complete.ps1 `
  -ProductionProject "elara-mvp-13082025-u1" `
  -TestProject "elara-test-20251023-yourname" `
  -EncryptionPassphrase $passphrase `

### Step 5: Review Test Results

After test completes, you'll see:

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                    TEST SUITE COMPLETE                        ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

Test Duration:    48.3 minutes
Total Tests:      32
Passed:           30
Failed:           0
Warnings:         2

Snapshot Created: 8.5 minutes
Restore Time:     17.2 minutes

✅ ✅ ✅  VERIFICATION COMPLETE - 100% SUCCESS  ✅ ✅ ✅

Your snapshot/restore system is FULLY FUNCTIONAL and PRODUCTION-READY.

You can now SAFELY:
1. Delete Cloud SQL replicas (save $1,400/month)
2. Downsize Cloud SQL primary (save $400/month)
3. Total savings: $1,800/month

If ANYTHING goes wrong → Restore in 15-20 minutes!

Detailed Report: D:\Elara_Test_Results\test-report-20251023-143022.md
Test Results: D:\Elara_Test_Results\test-results-20251023-143022.json
All Evidence: D:\Elara_Test_Results
```

### Step 6: Review Detailed Report

```powershell
# Open the detailed report
notepad D:\Elara_Test_Results\test-report-*.md

# Or view in browser (better formatting)
code D:\Elara_Test_Results\test-report-*.md
```

The report contains:
- ✅ Executive summary (pass/fail counts)
- ✅ Complete test results table
- ✅ Infrastructure comparison (production vs test)
- ✅ **Final verdict** with certification or issues list

### Step 7: Manual Verification (Optional but Recommended)

**Test the restored environment yourself:**

```powershell
# Get test environment load balancer IP
gcloud container clusters get-credentials elara-gke-cluster --region=us-west1 --project=elara-test-20251023-yourname
kubectl get service -n elara-proxy elara-ingress-nginx

# Output example: 34.82.xxx.xxx

# Open in browser
http://34.82.xxx.xxx
```

**Manual checks:**
- [ ] Frontend loads
- [ ] Can login (if you have test credentials)
- [ ] API health endpoint works: `http://34.82.xxx.xxx/v2/health`
- [ ] No errors in browser console

### Step 8: Cleanup Test Project

```powershell
# At the end of the test script, you'll be prompted:
Delete test project 'elara-test-20251023-yourname' to avoid costs? (y/n)

# Type 'y' to delete (recommended)
# Or manually delete later:
gcloud projects delete elara-test-20251023-yourname
```

- Kubernetes Manifests: No manifests captured
- Test Database Connectivity: Connection failed

Recommendation: DO NOT DELETE PRODUCTION RESOURCES YET
```

**What this means:**
- ⚠️ Snapshot/restore has bugs
- ⚠️ Need to fix issues before proceeding
- ❌ **DO NOT DELETE PRODUCTION YET**

**Next steps:**
1. Review failed tests in report
2. Fix issues (likely script bugs or permissions)
3. Re-run test
4. Get PASS result before deleting production

## 🔍 Understanding Test Categories

### Critical Tests (Must Pass)

These MUST pass for certification:
- ✅ Snapshot Creation
- ✅ Database Dump
- ✅ Kubernetes Manifests
- ✅ Snapshot Restore
- ✅ Test Database Connectivity
- ✅ Database Schema Match

**If ANY critical test fails → DO NOT DELETE PRODUCTION**

### Important Tests (Should Pass)

These should pass but warnings are acceptable:
- ✅ Production API Health
- ✅ Test API Health Check
- ✅ Database Tier Match
- ✅ GKE Node Count Match

**Warnings are OK** (e.g., test uses smaller tier than production)

### Informational Tests (Can Vary)

These are informational:
- Pod counts (can vary due to auto-scaling)
- API response times (acceptable range)
- Node readiness (may take time)

## ⏱️ Timeline Breakdown

| Phase | Duration | Can I Leave? |
|-------|----------|--------------|
| 1. Capture production state | 2-3 min | No |
| 2. Create snapshot | 5-10 min | Yes (watch for errors) |
| 3. Prepare test project | 1 min | No |
| 4. Restore snapshot | 15-20 min | Yes (longest phase) |
| 5. Capture test state | 2-3 min | No |
| 6. Compare environments | 5 min | No |

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Test Fails to Start

**Error:** "Cannot find snapshot script"
```powershell
# Fix: Ensure you're in correct directory
cd D:\Elara_MVP\gcp-infrastructure\scripts
ls *.ps1  # Should see test script
```

**Error:** "Execution policy prevents running script"
```powershell
# Fix: Set execution policy
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

### Test Fails During Snapshot

**Error:** "Database dump not created"
- Check Cloud SQL is accessible: `gcloud sql instances list`
- Verify permissions: `gcloud auth list`
- Check disk space: `Get-PSDrive D`

**Error:** "Kubernetes manifests not captured"
- Verify kubectl works: `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`
- Check GKE credentials: `gcloud container clusters get-credentials elara-gke-cluster`

### Test Fails During Restore

**Error:** "Test project creation failed"
- Project ID must be globally unique (try different name)
- Check billing is enabled on test project

**Error:** "Restore timeout"
- GKE cluster creation takes 5-7 minutes (be patient)
- Cloud SQL creation takes 5-10 minutes (normal)

### Test Passes but Manual Check Fails

**Issue:** Can't access test environment at http://IP
- Wait 5-10 minutes for pods to fully start
- Check pods: `kubectl get pods --all-namespaces`
- Check load balancer: `kubectl get service -n elara-proxy`
