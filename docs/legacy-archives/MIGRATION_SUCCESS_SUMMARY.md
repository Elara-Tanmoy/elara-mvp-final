## 🔒 SAFETY MEASURES TAKEN

1. ✅ **Full backup created** before migration
   - Backup ID: 1761258861495
   - Export: gs://elara-mvp-13082025-u1-backups/pre-migration-20251023-184115.sql
   - Size: 40.74 MiB
   - Status: SUCCESSFUL

2. ✅ **Zero data loss verified**
   - All data exported from old instance
   - All data imported to new instance
   - Database integrity confirmed

3. ✅ **Rolling restart**
   - No downtime during pod restarts
   - Health checks passing throughout

4. ✅ **Old infrastructure preserved**
   - Old Cloud SQL instances still running
   - Can rollback instantly if needed

gcloud sql instances delete elara-postgres-replica-1 --quiet

# Delete replica 2
gcloud sql instances delete elara-postgres-replica-2-dr --quiet

# Delete primary (last)
gcloud sql instances delete elara-postgres-primary --quiet
```

**Estimated time to delete:** 5-10 minutes
**Cost savings start:** Immediately after deletion
