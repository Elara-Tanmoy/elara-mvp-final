- ✅ All data encrypted in transit (TLS)
- ✅ Private IP only (10.190.1.11 - no public access)
- ✅ VPC-native networking
- ✅ Service account authentication
- ✅ Secrets managed via Kubernetes Secrets

### Backup & DR:

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS (Optional)

### Further Optimizations (When Needed):
1. **Monitor Usage:**
   - Track database CPU and memory usage
   - Alert if approaching 70% capacity
   - Scale up proactively if needed

2. **Cost Monitoring:**
   - Verify $1,560/month savings in next bill
   - Monitor for any unexpected charges
   - Consider reserved capacity if usage stable

3. **Performance Tuning:**
   - Optimize slow queries if any
   - Add indexes as needed
   - Consider connection pooling if needed

4. **Scaling Strategy:**
   - Can scale up to db-custom-4-15360 if needed (~$480/mo)
   - Can add read replicas when traffic increases
   - Can enable Cross-Region DR replica if required

### Future Considerations:
- ✅ Current setup supports 20K+ users (well beyond MVP needs)
- ✅ Can scale vertically (bigger machine) or horizontally (add replicas)
- ✅ Can enable automatic storage increase
- ✅ Can add Redis Enterprise if caching needs increase
