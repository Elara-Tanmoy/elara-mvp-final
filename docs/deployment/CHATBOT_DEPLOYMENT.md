## üöÄ DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### Step 1: Enable pgvector Extension

Connect to your PostgreSQL database and run:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```

**How to do this:**

**Option A: Using psql**
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;"
```

**Option B: Using database GUI**
- Connect to your database using pgAdmin, DBeaver, or similar
- Run the SQL command in the query editor

**Option C: For Render.com (Recommended)**
```bash
# Get your database URL from Render dashboard
# Replace with your actual DATABASE_URL
psql "postgresql://user:password@host:port/database" -c "CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;"
```

### Step 2: Run Database Migration

Navigate to the backend directory and run the migration:

```bash
cd packages/backend

# Make sure DATABASE_URL is set in your environment
# Run the migration
psql $DATABASE_URL -f prisma/migrations/20251007_add_chatbot_tables/migration.sql
```

**This migration creates:**
- `chatbot_config` - Configuration table with default settings
- `knowledge_base` - Vector embeddings storage (1536 dimensions)
- `chat_sessions` - Session management
- `chat_messages` - Conversation history
- `chatbot_training_data` - Training uploads tracking
- `chatbot_analytics` - Usage metrics
- **10 pre-loaded knowledge entries** about cybersecurity

**Verify migration success:**
```sql
-- Check if tables were created
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
AND table_name LIKE 'chatbot%' OR table_name = 'knowledge_base';

-- Should return 6 tables:
-- chatbot_config
-- chatbot_analytics
-- chatbot_training_data
-- knowledge_base
-- chat_sessions
-- chat_messages
```

### Step 3: Verify Environment Variables

Make sure these are set in your `.env` file and production environment:

```bash
# Already configured (no changes needed):
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-***      # Claude Sonnet 4.5
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-***             # For embeddings
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://***      # PostgreSQL with pgvector
REDIS_HOST=***                     # Optional (uses mock if not set)
CHROMADB_URL=***                   # Optional (not used by chatbot)

# No additional API keys needed! ‚úÖ
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies (If Not Already Installed)

```bash
cd packages/backend
npm install @anthropic-ai/sdk openai pg csv-parse

cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### Step 5: Build and Deploy

**Backend:**
```bash
cd packages/backend
npm run build
npm start
```

**Frontend:**
```bash
cd packages/frontend
npm run build
# Deploy the dist folder to your hosting service
```

**For Render.com (Automatic):**
- Push to your repository
- Render will automatically build and deploy
- Make sure build commands are correct in render.yaml

### Step 6: Verify Deployment

**Test Backend API:**
```bash
# Health check
curl https://your-backend-url.com/api/health

# Test chatbot (public endpoint)
curl -X POST https://your-backend-url.com/api/v2/chatbot/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What is phishing?"}'

# Test knowledge search (public endpoint)
curl https://your-backend-url.com/api/v2/chatbot/knowledge/search?q=phishing

# Test config (public read)
curl https://your-backend-url.com/api/v2/chatbot/config
```

**Test Frontend:**
1. Open your app: `https://your-frontend-url.com`
2. Login as admin user
3. Click floating chatbot button (bottom-right)
4. Send a message: "What is phishing?"
5. Navigate to "Chatbot Admin" in navbar

## üéØ USAGE TIPS

### For Admins

**Adding Specialized Knowledge:**
1. Identify common user questions from analytics
2. Create comprehensive knowledge entries
3. Use specific categories for better retrieval
4. Include actionable steps in content

**Optimizing Performance:**
- Monitor response times in analytics
- Adjust max tokens if responses are too long/short
- Tune temperature based on desired response style
- Add more knowledge entries to improve accuracy

**Training Data Management:**
- Use CSV for bulk uploads (fastest)
- Use Text for documents/articles
- Use JSON for structured data
- Monitor training history for failures

### For Users

**Getting Best Results:**
- Ask specific questions
- Provide context when needed
- Use follow-up questions for clarification
- Rate conversations to improve the system

**Example Good Questions:**
- "How can I tell if an email is a phishing attempt?"
- "What should I do if I clicked a suspicious link?"
- "How do I enable two-factor authentication on Gmail?"
- "I received a text claiming to be from my bank. Is it real?"

**Example Bad Questions:**
- "Help" (too vague)
- "asdfgh" (nonsensical)
- Questions completely unrelated to cybersecurity

---

## üìà SCALING CONSIDERATIONS

### Performance
- **Vector Search:** Uses ivfflat index for fast similarity search
- **Session Storage:** PostgreSQL handles millions of sessions
- **Embeddings:** Cached in database, no need to regenerate
- **Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse, configurable per tier

### Costs
- **Claude API:** ~$3 per 1M input tokens, ~$15 per 1M output tokens
- **OpenAI Embeddings:** ~$0.13 per 1M tokens
- **Database:** pgvector extension is free
- **Estimated:** $20-50/month for 10k messages (varies by usage)

### Optimization
- Knowledge base entries are embedded once (not per query)
- Conversation history limited to last N messages
- Response caching can be added if needed
- Consider batch embedding for large uploads

---

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "pgvector extension not found"
**Solution:**
```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```
If this fails, your PostgreSQL version might be too old (need 11+) or pgvector isn't installed.

### Issue: "Failed to generate embeddings"
**Solution:**
- Check `OPENAI_API_KEY` is valid
- Verify OpenAI API quota/billing
- Check network connectivity to OpenAI

### Issue: "Claude API error"
**Solution:**
- Check `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is valid
- Verify Anthropic API quota/billing
- Check request size (context window limits)

### Issue: "Chatbot widget not appearing"
**Solution:**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify `ChatbotWidget` is imported in `Layout.tsx`
- Check z-index conflicts with other elements

### Issue: "Admin panel shows 'unauthorized'"
**Solution:**
- Verify user role is 'admin' in database
- Check authentication token is valid
- Verify admin middleware is working
